# WatchDiff AI Collaboration Roadmap

## Vision
Transform WatchDiff into the premier AI-human collaboration tool for developers working with AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other AI agents.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Diff Visualization âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Make AI-generated changes more visible and understandable

#### Features âœ… **ALL IMPLEMENTED**

  - Detect and label changes by source (human, AI agent, tool)
  - Visual indicators for different change origins (ðŸ‘¤ human, ðŸ¤– AI, ðŸ”§ tool)
  - Process monitoring to identify AI tool activity

- **Confidence Scoring System** âœ…
  - Risk assessment for each change (ðŸŸ¢ safe, ðŸŸ¡ review, ðŸ”´ risky)
  - Pattern detection for common AI mistakes (unsafe code, unwrap, debug prints)
  - File type and complexity-based scoring with language-specific bonuses

- **Enhanced Visual Indicators** âœ…
  - Color-coded risk levels in TUI with confidence percentages
  - Change batch visualization for large AI modifications
  - Improved diff formatting with origin and confidence display

- **Smart Change Grouping** âœ…
  - Group related changes with batch IDs
  - Time-based batching for AI sessions (3-5 second windows)
  - Show batch information in TUI

#### Implementation Completed âœ…
- âœ… Extended `FileEvent` struct with origin, confidence, and batch_id fields
- âœ… Created comprehensive `ChangeConfidence` scoring algorithm with pattern rules
- âœ… Added risk indicators to TUI rendering with visual symbols and colors
- âœ… Implemented smart batch change detection with time-based grouping
- âœ… Created AI pattern detection rules for 6+ risky patterns

- **6 AI tools detected**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot, Codeium, TabNine
- **Advanced pattern detection**: Unsafe code, unwrap usage, debug output, TODOs, lint suppressions
- **Real-time visualization**: Changes show origin, confidence, and batch info in TUI
- **Performance optimized**: LRU caching and efficient process monitoring

### Phase 2: Interactive Review Controls âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Enable seamless accept/reject workflow for AI changes

#### Features âœ… **ALL IMPLEMENTED**
- **Interactive Change Review** âœ…
  - Accept/reject individual hunks (like `git add -p`)
  - Skip to next/previous change with keyboard shortcuts
  - Bulk accept/reject for trusted patterns

- **Enhanced Navigation** âœ…
  - Jump between high-risk changes
  - Filter view by confidence level and multiple criteria
  - Advanced filtering with regex and pattern matching

- **Session Management** âœ…
  - Session persistence to disk (save/load functionality)
  - Track review progress across files
  - Resume interrupted review sessions
  - Filter presets with keyboard shortcuts

- **Smart Actions** ðŸš§
  - [ ] One-click fixes for common AI mistakes (Future Phase 3)
  - [ ] Auto-formatting after accepting changes (Future Phase 3)
  - [ ] Quick rollback for problematic changes (Future Phase 3)

#### Implementation Progress âœ… **ENHANCED FEATURES COMPLETED**
- âœ… Added interactive review mode to TUI (press 'r' to enter)
- âœ… Implemented hunk-level diff parsing and display
- âœ… Created comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for review actions
- âœ… Built review session state management
- âœ… Added visual review interface with progress tracking
- âœ… Built advanced change filtering system with multiple criteria
- âœ… Added session state persistence to disk (save/load functionality)
- âœ… Implemented filter presets with keyboard shortcuts (1-5 keys)
- âœ… Added visual indicators for active filters in review header
- âœ… Comprehensive filtering: confidence, origin, file patterns, hunk counts, review status
- âœ… Session management: save, load, and resume review sessions

#### Current Keyboard Shortcuts
- **r** - Enter review mode
- **a** - Accept current hunk
- **d** - Reject current hunk  
- **s** - Skip current hunk
- **A** - Accept all hunks in current change
- **D** - Reject all hunks in current change
- **n/p** - Next/Previous change
- **j/k** - Next/Previous hunk
- **R** - Jump to next risky change
- **u** - Jump to first unreviewed change
- **f** - Toggle filters
- **1-5** - Apply filter presets (Risky, AI, Pending, Low Confidence, Large Changes)
- **S** - Save current review session
- **L** - Load saved review session
- **q** - Exit review mode

### Phase 3: AI Agent Integration ðŸ¤–
**Goal**: Deep integration with AI coding tools and workflows

#### Features
- **AI Tool Detection**
  - Monitor for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other AI processes
  - Hook into Language Server Protocol (LSP) communications
  - Detect AI tool startup/shutdown events

- **Workflow Automation**
  - Auto-trigger testing when AI completes changes
  - Integrate with build systems for real-time feedback
  - Smart git staging of reviewed changes

- **Advanced Analytics**
  - Track AI accuracy over time
  - Identify problematic AI patterns
  - Generate collaboration reports

- **API Integration**
  - Direct integration with Claude Code APIs
  - Support for custom AI tool plugins
  - Webhook support for external integrations

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create AI process monitoring system
- [ ] Build LSP integration layer
- [ ] Implement workflow automation engine
- [ ] Add analytics and reporting
- [ ] Create plugin system for AI tools

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] 95% accuracy in change origin detection
- [ ] Visual risk indicators reduce review time by 30%
- [ ] Pattern detection catches 80% of common AI mistakes

### Phase 2 Success Criteria âœ… **ALL ACHIEVED**

- Preserve backward compatibility

### Dependencies
- Process monitoring: `sysinfo` or `procfs`
- LSP integration: `tower-lsp` or custom implementation
- Configuration: Extend existing `serde`/`toml` setup
- Plugin system: `libloading` for dynamic loading

### Performance Targets
- Maintain <100ms response time for UI updates
- Support monitoring 10,000+ files simultaneously  
- Keep memory usage under 50MB baseline

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Enhanced AI visualization with confidence scoring and origin tracking
- **Phase 2**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Interactive review controls with advanced filtering and session management  
- **Phase 3**: ðŸš§ **PLANNED** - Deep AI integration with workflow automation (4-6 weeks)

## Future Vision
WatchDiff becomes the essential tool for any developer working with AI coding assistants, providing confidence, control, and insight into AI-human collaborative development workflows.
